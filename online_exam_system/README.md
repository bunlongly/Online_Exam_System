1. Unzip the Project

First, ensure that the zip file is extracted to your desired working directory. You can usually do this via your file manager, but here's a command if you're using a Unix-like system:

bash

unzip path/to/yourproject.zip -d destination_folder

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the project directory:

bash

cd destination_folder

3. Install Composer Dependencies

Install the PHP dependencies required by Laravel:

bash

composer install

4. Copy and Configure the Environment File

Copy the example environment file and modify it according to your environment settings:

bash

cp .env.example .env

Then edit the .env file to set up things like your app key, database, and mail settings.
5. Generate the Application Key

Generate a unique app key with the Laravel artisan command:

bash

php artisan key:generate

6. Install Node.js Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js packages (like Vite, Tailwind CSS):

bash

npm install

7. Build Frontend Assets

Compile your CSS and JavaScript files:

bash

npm run dev  # For development
# or
npm run build  # For production

8. Run Database Migrations

Set up your database tables and seed data (if applicable):

bash

php artisan migrate

9. Serve the Application

Finally, use Laravel's built-in server to serve your application:

bash

php artisan serve
